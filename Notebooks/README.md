Jupyter notebooks with sklearn implementations of the following models for the project:
- Decision tree classifier
- Random forest classifier
- Support vector classifier
- K-nearest neigbor classifier

Furthermore, the directory may contain some additional notebooks outside of model implementations, such as the "stats" notebook, which includes some brief analysis of the dataset. 

#TODO: Update to newest versions, remove redundant/outdated notebooks
