## Instructions

### CSV-files
To run the classifier-notebooks, make sure that you have "OnehotAll.csv" and "OnehotAll.csv" in the same directory as the open kernel. 
For the data-exploration notebook, make sure you have "StudentsPerformance.csv" in the same directory as the open kernel.

### Libraries
Libraries that are needed for code running
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Sklearn (scikit-learn)
* Seaborn

### Classifier notebooks
All code content related to each classifier is located in their respective notebook:
- "Decision tree classifier.ipynb"
- "Random forest classifier.ipynb"
- "SVM Classifier.ipynb"
- "KNN classifier.ipynb"

Having the required packages and CSV-files, the kernel should run smoothly. Note that values of f.ex. train_test_splits are changed throughout experimenting, and the values and setups given in the notebooks are just the final versions when coding was finished.

The notebooks also contain a fair amount of comment and structure, which should be intuitive with some knowledge and experience with machine learning coding (sklearn and pandas mainly)

### Other 
The "Data exploration" notebook is mostly for our own sake, used during data exploring in the early project phase. This notebook may be outdated/incomplete, however it is not crucial to the project. If you wish to run this, make sure to have the needed CSV as stated at the top.
