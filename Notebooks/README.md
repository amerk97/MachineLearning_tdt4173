## Instructions

To run the notebooks, make sure that you have "StudentsPerformance.csv", "OnehotAll.csv" and "OnehotAll.csv" in the same directory as the open notebook.
The packages mainly used are numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and pandas. These are needed to run the code. 

All code content related to each classifier is located in their respective notebook:
- Decision tree classifier
- Random forest classifier
- Support vector classifier
- K-nearest neigbor classifier

The notebook kernels should not need any modifications, and should be able to run as long as you have the correct CSV-files in your directory.
